# Python Projects Repository

Welcome to my Python projects repository! Here, you will find various projects I have worked on related to spam SMS detection, customer churn prediction, and movie genre classification.

## Projects Overview

### Spam SMS Detection

This project is aimed at detecting spam SMS messages using machine learning algorithms. It involves preprocessing the SMS text data, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation. The main goal is to classify SMS messages as spam or non-spam accurately.

### Customer Churn Prediction

Customer churn prediction is essential for businesses to identify customers who are likely to leave. This project focuses on predicting customer churn using historical data such as customer demographics, usage patterns, and transaction history. Various machine learning models are trained and evaluated to predict churn accurately.

### Movie Genre Classification

Movie genre classification involves predicting the genre(s) of a given movie based on its plot summary, metadata, or other features. In this project, I have implemented machine learning algorithms to classify movies into different genres. The models are trained using movie descriptions and evaluated based on their accuracy in genre prediction.

## How to Use

Each project is contained within its own directory with a detailed README file and Python scripts. Follow the instructions provided in each project's README to set up the environment, preprocess data, train models, and evaluate performance.
